#### **2.3 Streaming Stored Audio and Video**
- **Definition**: Media files stored on servers that users can access remotely through the Internet.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Large File Size**: Multimedia files are typically large (especially high-quality video).
  - **Bandwidth Requirements**: Stable and high bandwidth is required to maintain the quality of service.
  - **Compression**: Essential for reducing file sizes without excessively degrading quality.
  
##### **Key Streaming Technologies**
- **Progressive Download**:
  - Allows users to start playing media while downloading, but requires full download before playback completes.
  
- **Adaptive Streaming**:
  - Adjusts the quality of the stream in real-time based on the user’s bandwidth.
  - Examples: **MPEG-DASH**, **Apple HLS**.
  
##### **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**
- **Definition**: A network of distributed servers that deliver content to users from the nearest server to reduce latency.
- **Purpose**: To offload traffic from the origin server, reduce **latency**, and improve **reliability**.
- **Examples**: Akamai, Cloudflare.

#### **2.4 Real-Time Audio/Video**
- **Definition**: Real-time multimedia applications enable users to interact in live communication with minimal delays.
- **Examples**: VoIP (Voice over IP), video conferencing tools like Zoom, and live broadcasting applications.
  
##### **Key Characteristics of Real-Time Applications**
- **Low Latency**: Delays between sending and receiving data must be minimized.
- **Jitter Control**: Variability in packet arrival times (jitter) needs to be managed.
- **Synchronization**: Audio and video must remain synchronized to ensure seamless communication.
  
##### **Protocols for Real-Time Audio/Video**
- **RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol)**:
  - Used for delivering audio and video data with added timestamps and sequence numbers for synchronization.
  
- **RTCP (Real-Time Control Protocol)**:
  - Provides feedback about the quality of the RTP stream (e.g., packet loss, delay, jitter).
  
- **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)**:
  - Establishes, modifies, and terminates multimedia sessions, commonly used in VoIP.

##### **Challenges**
- **Packet Loss**: Can severely degrade quality in audio/video streams.
- **Network Congestion**: Increases delays and jitter, making it difficult to maintain QoS.
- **Bandwidth**: Real-time applications need enough bandwidth to prevent buffering or freezes.

#### **2.5 Voice over IP (VoIP)**
- **Definition**: A technology that allows voice communication over IP networks instead of traditional phone lines.
- **Examples**: **Skype, WhatsApp calls, Zoom, Google Voice**.

##### **How VoIP Works**
- **Digitization**: Converts analog voice signals into digital data.
- **Compression**: Compresses the voice data to reduce size (e.g., G.729 codec).
- **Packetization**: Divides the voice data into small packets, then transmits it over the network using **RTP**.
- **Reconstruction**: The packets are reassembled at the receiver's end to recreate the original voice signal.

##### **Protocols Used in VoIP**
- **RTP**: Transports voice data with timestamps to maintain order and timing.
- **SIP**: Manages session establishment and teardown for voice communication.
- **H.323**: An older standard for VoIP, replaced by SIP in many applications.

##### **Challenges in VoIP**
- **Delay**: High delays affect call quality and real-time interaction.
- **Jitter**: Uneven packet arrival times cause voice distortion.
- **Packet Loss**: Missing packets can lead to poor audio quality.

---

#### **2.6 Video Conferencing**
- **Definition**: Real-time, interactive video communication between two or more users.
- **Examples**: **Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet**.

##### **Technical Requirements for Video Conferencing**
- **High Bandwidth**: Video streams consume large amounts of data, especially in HD.
- **Low Latency**: Real-time interaction requires minimal delay to maintain conversation flow.
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Must prioritize video data over less time-sensitive traffic on the network.

##### **Challenges**
- **Packet Loss**: Leads to frozen images or dropped video frames.
- **Latency**: Delays in communication can cause interruptions or awkward pauses.
- **Jitter**: Must be controlled to maintain video synchronization with audio.

---

#### **2.7 Adaptive Streaming**
- **Definition**: A technique that adjusts the video quality dynamically based on the available bandwidth.
  
##### **How Adaptive Streaming Works**
- **Segmentation**: Media files are broken into small chunks.
- **Multiple Quality Levels**: Different versions of the same video are created at various quality levels (e.g., 240p, 480p, 1080p).
- **Dynamic Selection**: The client player (e.g., YouTube app) automatically chooses the best quality that the network can handle in real-time.
  
##### **Common Adaptive Streaming Protocols**
- **MPEG-DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)**:
  - An open standard that adjusts video quality based on real-time network conditions.
  
- **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)**:
  - Apple’s adaptive streaming technology used for iOS and macOS devices.

##### **Advantages of Adaptive Streaming**
- **Improved User Experience**: Users get the best possible video quality without buffering, even when network conditions fluctuate.
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Adapts to current bandwidth availability, preventing unnecessary congestion.

#### **2.8 Multimedia File Compression**
- **Definition**: Reducing the size of multimedia files to minimize bandwidth usage and storage requirements.
  
##### **Compression Types**
1. **Lossy Compression**:
   - Discards some data to achieve smaller file sizes, often resulting in some quality loss.
   - Examples: **MP3 for audio**, **MPEG for video**.
  
2. **Lossless Compression**:
   - Reduces file size without losing any data, but less effective for large files.
   - Examples: **FLAC for audio**, **PNG for images**.

##### **Popular Compression Standards**
- **JPEG**: A commonly used lossy compression format for images.
- **MP3**: A popular audio format that uses lossy compression to significantly reduce file size.
- **H.264/AVC**: A widely used video compression standard, providing high quality at lower bitrates.

#### **2.9 Quality of Service (QoS) in Multimedia Applications**
- **Definition**: Techniques used to ensure the smooth transmission of multimedia data, even during network congestion.
  
##### **Key QoS Metrics**
- **Latency**: The time taken for data to travel from source to destination.
- **Jitter**: Variability in packet arrival times.
- **Bandwidth**: The capacity of the network to handle data transmissions.
- **Packet Loss**: The percentage of packets lost during transmission.

##### **QoS Techniques**
- **Traffic Prioritization**: Ensures real-time applications (e.g., video conferencing) get higher priority than less urgent traffic (e.g., emails).
- **Traffic Shaping**: Controls the rate at which data is sent to avoid overwhelming the network.
- **Buffering**: Temporary storage of data to compensate for network variability and ensure smooth playback.
